### How to set ESLint if you want

I recommend using Vscode as your editor. If so, inside your `settings.json` file, include the following configuration in order to get automatic fixing whenever saving a file:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": false,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  }
}
```
